# Brand_Profiling_Crossselling
This is a script I ran in DAX Studio. It was used to query a certain group of customers (based on their purchase behaviour regarding a certain brand or category), in order to analyze what other products they use to purchase. It does not consider what other products they purchase within the same ticket, that will be uploaded in another use case. The business question that it answers is: What Categories do "Babies" customers purchase?. This was uploaded with dummy data, but in real life, it allowed a general understanding of some pattern in consumer behaviour regarding specific categories.
